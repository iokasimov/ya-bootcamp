2. Type `Kodama` in `Font Family` settings input in `Visual Studio Code` editor.
3. Clone this repo and try to `cabal build`.

## Mapping assignments

In this module you will learn how to use infix functor operators - once you finish it, shape of operators start making sense.

The task is to replace `yi` operators with another one - just make it compile.
Only `Hom`/`Yoneda` operators should be involved (including their compositions).

Here are some tips that could help you to solve these assignments:

* On functor composition, contravariant (`a`) position play the same role as `True` in `XOR` operation.
* You should provide label per each Kleisli token (`k`) in your operator - use universal `Run` (`_M11`..`_M15`).
* If you feel you are stuck with positions, transform infix notation into prefix.

Solutions for this module are available at [this commit](https://github.com/iokasimov/ya-bootcamp/blob/81750725dcf620cc903d00fec792f1ec2b8b3ed7/Ya/Bootcamp/Mappings.hs).
